## Overview  
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of building a neural network model, from data preprocessing to final model evaluation. The goal is to accurately classify clothing items into one of ten categories using a supervised learning approach.  

---

## Dataset  
The **Fashion MNIST** dataset contains:
- **Training set:** 60,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels)
- **Test set:** 10,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels)  
Each image belongs to one of the following 10 categories:  
1. T-shirt/top  
2. Trouser  
3. Pullover  
4. Dress  
5. Coat  
6. Sandal  
7. Shirt  
8. Sneaker  
9. Bag  
10. Ankle boot

## Project Pipeline  
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Normalized pixel values to the range [0, 1] to aid model convergence.  
   - One-hot encoded the target labels for classification tasks.  

2. **Model Design**  
   - Built a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** with multiple layers (Convolution, MaxPooling, Flatten, Dense).  
   - Experimented with different **optimizers** (e.g., Adam, Adadelta) and **loss functions** (categorical cross-entropy).  

3. **Training**  
   - Trained the CNN model on the Fashion MNIST training set.  
   - Used **early stopping** and **learning rate schedules** to optimize performance.  

4. **Evaluation**  
   - Evaluated the model on the test set using metrics like **accuracy** and **loss**.  
   - Visualized training/validation accuracy and loss curves.

## Model Architecture  
- **Input Layer:** 28x28 grayscale images  
- **Convolutional Layers:** Extracted spatial features  
- **MaxPooling Layers:** Reduced feature map size  
- **Dense Layers:** Final decision-making layers for classification  

---

## Results  
- **Best Optimizer:** Adadelta  
- **Best Loss Function:** Categorical Cross-Entropy  
- **Test Accuracy:** ~90.85%  
- **Training Time:** ~24.23 seconds  
- **Loss:** 28.59%  

The model demonstrated strong performance with 90.85% accuracy on unseen data, indicating its ability to generalize well.
